This project works alongside 'bread-backend' to display the functionalities of CRUD: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
This app has the ability to 'Create' data within the database by adding a new bread containing three pieces of data. On the New page, the user
    can customize a new bread with a name, checkbox, and image. The name is a required field. If no image is provided, a default image will be displayed on that 
    bread's page. The default for gluten is 'true'.
This app has the ability to 'Read' data within the database by clicking on one of the existing breads in the list.
    This page displays the data from the database for this bread.
This app has the ability to 'Update' data within the database by editing an existing bread. After selecting an existing bread from the list, the user can click on
    the Edit button, which will take them to the Edit page where they have the ability to update the data of a bread by changing one of its three pieces of data.
This app has the ability to 'Delete' data within the database by removing a bread. After selecting an existing bread from the list, the user can click on the Delete button,
    which will return the user to the Home page and the selected bread will be deleted permanently.

This application was styled using react-bootstrap.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
